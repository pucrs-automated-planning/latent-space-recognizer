[[./install.sh][install.sh]] should install the required libraries on a standard Ubuntu rig.
It requires =sudo= several times. However Python packages are installed in the user directory.

Run =do-everything.sh= to generate the problem instances, train the network etc.

** Required software (install.sh)

install.sh only works on ubuntu.

: mercurial g++ cmake make python flex bison g++-multilib

For compiling Fast Downward. FD is just compiled, not installed.

: git build-essential automake libcurl4-openssl-dev

For compiling [Roswell](http://roswell.github.io/).
OSX users should use =brew install roswell=.

: python3-pip python3-pil parallel bash-completion byobu htop parallel mosh git

Some are not necessary :)

: tensorflow keras h5py matplotlib progressbar2 timeout_decorator ansicolors scipy scikit-image

I didn't follow the latest keras, though. (It works in 2.0.5)
This part may not work right.

** file structure

+ model.py :: network definitions.
+ strips.py :: (Bad name!) the program for training an SAE,
               and writes the input images/transitions to a CSV file.
+ state_discriminator3.py :: The program for training an SD.
+ action_autoencoder.py :: The program for training an AAE.
+ action_discriminator.py :: The program for training an AD.
+ fd-planner.py :: Latplan using AMA1.
+ trivial-planner.py :: Latplan using AMA2.
+ run_ama1_all.sh, run_ama2_all.sh :: Run all experiments. Beware! You need a good compute resource!
+ config.py :: keras/tensorflow config related
+ various junk sh files :: support scripts.
+ util/ :: utility files
+ tests/ :: test files, mostly the unit tests for domain generator/validator
+ samples/ :: where the learned results should go. Each SAE training results in a properly named directory.
+ puzzles/ :: code for domain generators/validators.
  + puzzles/*.py :: each file represents a domain. 
  + puzzles/model/*.py :: the core model (successor rules etc.) of the domain. this is disentangled from the images.
+ problem-instances/ :: where the input problem isntances / experimental results should go.
+ helper/ :: helper scripts for AMA1.
+ (git submodule) planner-scripts/ :: My personal scripts for invoking domain-independent planners.
     Not just Fast Downward.
+ (git submodule) downward/ :: My personally maintained version of Fast Downward, forked around 2015.
